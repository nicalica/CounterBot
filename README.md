# CounterBot

[CounterBot](https://app-2swb3drj4a-uk.a.run.app/) is a chatbot designed to combat hate speech through generating counterspeech that challenges the hate narrative.

**Counterspeech** is responding to hate with feedback that undermines hate speech, providing an enticing alternative to the content blocking and censorship system. The main advantage of counterspeech is that it preserves the freedom of speech; nevertheless, the effort of manually generating counterspeech prevents it from being effective at reducing hate at scale. By utilizing large language models however, it becomes feasible to augment the process of detecting hate and generating counterspeech to extend to a larger use case e.g. reducing hate on social media platforms.
